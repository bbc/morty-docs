## Paragraphs
### Bold
**Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.**
### Italic
_Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book._
### Strike-Through
~~It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.~~
### Code line
`It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.`
